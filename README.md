# fast-glob

## Introduce

A high-performance glob matching crate for Rust based on [`devongovett/glob-match`](https://github.com/devongovett/glob-match).

**Key Features:**

- Up to 60% performance improvement.
- Supports more complete and well-rounded features.

## Examples

```rust
use fast_glob::glob_match;

let glob = "some/**/n*d[k-m]e?txt";
let path = "some/a/bigger/path/to/the/crazy/needle.txt";

assert!(glob_match(glob, path));
```

## Syntax

| Syntax  | Meaning                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| ------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `?`     | Matches any single character.                                                                                                                                                                       |
| `*`     | Matches zero or more characters, except for path separators (e.g. `/`).                                                                                                                             |
| `**`    | Matches zero or more characters, including path separators. Must match a complete path segment (i.e. followed by a `/` or the end of the pattern).                                                  |
| `[ab]`  | Matches one of the characters contained in the brackets. Character ranges, e.g. `[a-z]` are also supported. Use `[!ab]` or `[^ab]` to match any character _except_ those contained in the brackets. |
| `{a,b}` | Matches one of the patterns contained in the braces. Any of the wildcard characters can be used in the sub-patterns. Braces may be nested up to 10 levels deep.                                     |
| `!`     | When at the start of the glob, this negates the result. Multiple `!` characters negate the glob multiple times.                                                                                     |
| `\`     | A backslash character may be used to escape any of the above special characters.                                                                                                                    |

## FAQ

### Why not use the more efficient `glob_match` for brace expansion?

`glob_match` is unable to handle complex brace expansions. Below are some failed examples:

- `glob_match("{a/b,a/b/c}/c", "a/b/c")`
- `glob_match("**/foo{bar,b*z}", "foobuzz")`
- `glob_match("**/{a,b}/c.png", "some/a/b/c.png")`

Due to these limitations, `brace expansion` requires a different implementation that can handle the complexity of such patterns, resulting in some performance trade-offs.
